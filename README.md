# Piknik News API

Designed to act as a backend news service, this API is intended to serve the data for a future frontend project, the culmination of which will be a fully functioning website.

Existing users are able to post articles on given topics, as well as to join discussions by commenting on them. A 'vote' feature is enabled for users to quickly respond to articles they liked or disliked. Further functionality is planned, including creating new users and topics, voting on comments, and more!
